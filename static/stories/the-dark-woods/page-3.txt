You spend a few moments screaming. You feel much better after. However, your screaming seems to have awoken one of the denizens of the forest.

A large monstrous bear stomps towards you. Except it has dark, jagged green skin. So jagged it almost hurts your eyes. With claws so wickedly pointed they gleam with the faint light leaking through the tree cover. With long ridges along its back which look as long and sharp as swords. With a tail like a scorpion, coiled and ready to strike.

On second thought, it doesn't really look like a bear. While you were taking in the sight of this fearsome creature it lumbered ever closer. It could be a good idea to start running now.
