You decide to stand your ground and speak with the bear-thing.

"Hail! How are you?" you shout, with only the faintest tremor of fear.

The bear, to your surprise, stops and stands on its hind legs. It looks at you for a long moment, and then its face scrunches up as if in surprise.

"Oh, you speak English?" it rumbled in a unexpectedly pleasant voice.

"Of course, I do. You speak English?"

"Well...obviously" the bear replied in a mildly condescending voice, "you must have fallen through the portal"

"Is that what happened? I don't remember anything."

"That's a typical symptom. I assume you would like to return home."

"Yeah, that would be pretty cool."

"Very well, let it be done" and the bear hooked one of its claws into its fur and pulled out a small rod. It glowed faintly and in the blink of an eye you were back in bed.

That was pretty easy. It wasn't the most exciting of journeys but you're just happy to be back in your bed. You wonder how long it would have taken you to return home had you not spoken to the bear-thing. But that's not your problem anymore because it is THE END.
