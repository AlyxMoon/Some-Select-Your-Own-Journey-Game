You awake to find yourself in a dreadful forest.The trees are numerous and sinister, the faintest rays of light peeking through the cover up above casting shadows upon the trunks that make them seem as if they are staring at you. Watching you.

So yeah, it's pretty dark and that's kind of scary. What's more scary is the fact that you don't remember anything about how you got here. Oooooh. Whatcha gonna do?
